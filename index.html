    <h1>Ayanokoji is so much like me, it's uncanny, he is unironically literally me. In fact he is not "like" me, he IS me, not only because we share the same personality by both treating people like tools and never considering anyone as a friend, only caring about winning in the end, but we also do the EXACT same actions, not figuratively, but absolutely literally exactly the same actions, i rigged my exams to have lower scores, because i don't want to stand out, and that's the same thing he did, when ayanokoji said "i've failed to have friends" i said the exact same thing in the start of my highschool, i also immediately identified the groups that formed naturally in the start of the semester, which is also the same thing he did in episode 1, someone also called the school to expel me, which is the same thing that happened to him as well. not only that, but i also have a harem of cute girls, i have a black haired girl that treats me like absolute garbage (but she actually loves me) i also told a blonde girl to spread her legs(she actually loves me so it's okay) i also have a girl with glasses act afraid near me(she actually loves me, she's just too shy too admit it) i was also at the last section of our school, and i also made everyone pass in that class in the last minute, with my genius strategy skills, i also tricked a lot of people to believe that the girl did everything, and i actually didn't do anything to save my class, they were just pawns in my big brain chess game with the school and they all helped to me winning in the end, i had strict parents that forced me to study very hard mathematical equations in a very young age to train me for school, which is also the exact same thing as to ayanokoji's childhood. It all adds up, and it all leads me to the same conclusion that he is literally me, no, HE IS ME!!!.  </h1>
